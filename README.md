## Installation

1. Install using pip:

   ```
   pip install vcolorpicker
   ```

   or clone the repository yourself and run:

   ```
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

2. To ask for a color, import the `getColor` function and run it:

   ```python
   from vcolorpicker import getColor
   
   color = getColor()
   ```

## Customization

* **Showing custom last color:**

   ```python
   old_color = (255,255,255)
   picked_color = getColor(old_color)
   ```

* **Changing the UI Theme**

  ```python
  from vcolorpicker import useLightTheme
  
  useLightTheme(True)
  ```

* **Adding Alpha selection**

  ```python
  from vcolorpicker import useAlpha
  
  useAlpha(True)
  ```

  When the ColorPicker uses Alpha, you have to pass a RGBA tuple\
  as the last color, otherwise there wil be an error.

  ```python
  old_color = (255,255,255,100)
  picked_color = getColor(old_color)  # => (r,g,b,a)
  ```

## Color Formats and Conversion

* The default format `getColor` will give you is RGB(A),\
  but you can use vcolorpickers color conversion functions\
  if you have a different format like HSV or HEX.

   `hsv2rgb` **HSV(A)** to **RGB(A)**\
   `rgb2hsv` **RGB(A)** to **HSV(A)**\
   `rgb2hex` **RGB(A)** to **HEX**\
   `hex2rgb` **HEX** to **RGB**\
   `hex2hsv` **HEX** to **HSV**\
   `hsv2hex` **HSV(A)** to **HEX**

* Example:
  ```python
  from vcolorpicker import getColor, hsv2rgb, rgb2hsv 
  
  old_color = hsv2rgb((50,50,100,100))  # => (127,255,255,100)

  picked_color = rgb2hsv(getColor(old_color))
  ```

* **Color Formats:**

  **RGB** values range from **0** to **255**\
  **HSV** values range from **0** to **100**\
  **HEX** values should be in format: `"XXXXXX"` or `"xxxxxx"`\
  **Alpha** values range from **0** to **100**


## Previous versions
  In previous versions you had to create a ColorPicker object first and then\
  call it's `getColor` method. This is still supported, you just have to\
  import the `ColorPicker` class.

  The color conversion functions are not methods anymore, you can import them\
  directly with `from vcolorpicker import hsv2rgb, rgb2hsv`.

  You also had to create a `QApplication` object before being able to run the\
  ColorPicker, now it automatically creates one by itself if there isn't one yet.\
  If you need to get the auto-created application, you can use this:

  ```python
  from qtpy.QtWidgets import QApplication
  app = QApplication.instance()
  ```

## Bugs and Improvement ideas
  If you find a bug, you can open an issue or write me an email (nlfmt@gmx.de)\
  and I will try to get to it as fast as possible, or you can implement it\
  yourself and create a pull request.
